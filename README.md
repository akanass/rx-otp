# One-Time Password manager

One Time Password manager is fully compliant with [HOTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) (counter based one time passwords) and [TOTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (time based one time passwords). It can be used in conjunction with the `Google Authenticator`, for Two-Factor Authentication, which has free apps for `iOS`, `Android` and `BlackBerry`.

All methods described in both `RFC` are implemented in [API](#api).

Now [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs) compliant, wrote in full [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html) | [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) for client and server side.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save @akanass/rx-otp rxjs

or

$ yarn add @akanass/rx-otp rxjs
```

## Super simple to use

**RX-OTP** is designed to be the simplest way possible to generate and verify OTP.

It's fully `Typescript` | `ES6` wrotten so you can import it :

```typescript
import {HOTP} from "@akanass/rx-otp";
```

or use `CommonJS`:

```javascript
const HOTP = require('@akanass/rx-otp').HOTP;
```

Now, it's easy to perform a generation of `HOTP`:

```typescript
HOTP.generate('12345678901234567890').subscribe(
    token => console.log(token), // display 125165 in the console
    err => console.error(err) // show error in console
);
```

## Build your project with Webpack

If you want to include this library inside a project builds with `webpack` for a `client` application, you must add this configuration inside your `webpack configuration`:

```javascript
{
    target: "web",
    node: {
        fs: "empty",
        net: "empty",
        tls: "empty"
    }
}
``` 

For a `server` application, `target` will be `node`, `node` block in configuration **doesn't exist** and `uglify` plugin must be `disabled`.
